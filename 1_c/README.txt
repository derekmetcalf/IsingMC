    As hypothesized in problem 1b, allowing the number of steps to scale with system size (in this case, by N^2), promotes equilibration of the system instead of the "stalling" seen when a larger system is allowed fewer steps to converge.
    The disordered system videos show this at work -- one converges almost immediately to a mostly-ordered system, but one persists in a nearly-50/50 split with two large interfaces until much after the previously alotted 1e6 steps, where it finally collapsed to the near-ordered state.
    Using number of cycles instead of steps makes the simulation scale as O(N^2) with system size. Of course this means the 60x60 system has 9 times more steps allowed before terminating, which proved useful in one of the randomly-initialized simulations.
