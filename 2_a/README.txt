    For the remainder of exercises, a system size of 20x20 run for 2500 cycles (1e6 steps, this is more than enough to equilibriate) is used. The average values of E and M and their squares are calculated in the MC_props routine. 
    For this system I decided it would be practical to compute the properties at the end of each cycle after half of the steps are complete (after 5e5 steps or 1250 cycles). This allows time for equilibration and samples properties from states in the trajectory afterwards. This delay is found in a (crude) implementation under the MC_traj routine, where an if statement determines if half of the cycles have elapsed yet. (of course checking steps works too but I wanted to stick with the cycle convention)
