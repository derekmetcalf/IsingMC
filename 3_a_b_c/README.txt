    The external field term is implemented in computing energy changes for single MC steps as well as total energies at the end of a cycle at equilibrium.
    At beta_J = 0.5, the average magnetization with H = 0 is 0.9114 and the average energy is -1.823, so a 5% change in energy (0.0912) with no change in magnetization corresponds to a 0.1 change in H. Applying this field, the energy goes down to -1.99 and the magnetization goes up to 0.94. This makes sense, the field is biasing the positive spin so fluctuations are decreased and the energy is allowed to average lower. There is some suceptibility, as the magnetization changes slightly.
    When starting the spins all down instead, a different minimum is found, reflecting the imposed lack of symmetry. Continually increasing the field strength drastically allows for more spins to be positive (or negative, depending on the bias of the field). Additionally, states starting from the disordered configuration seem to fall more frequently to the all-spin side favored by the field. This is consistent with the growing asymmetry.
