    For this section, a routine was constructed to measure properties as a function of temperatures ranging from 0.4 to 0.55 called "prop_v_temperature." Naturally, the Onsager result is populated with nans at temperatures higher than the critical point, which is expected as the magnetization as a function of temperature moves from double valued, to single-valued at the critical temperature, to unvalued. 
    The systems were initialized with all "up" spins for this section, simply to ensure all magnetizations share a sign with the Onsager result for plotting purposes. Random or down spins would work just as well with the algorithms provided, but the final magnetization would have to be an absolute value. This is consistent with intuition -- below the critical temperature, magnetization is perfectly symmetric and double valued with no external potential.
    The graph in this folder compares the Onsager result to the Monte Carlo result. The magnetizations match very closely below the critical temperature, then begin to diverge and become very noisy approaching the critical temp. The Onsager magnetization declines rapidly to 0 at the critical temp, but the MC simulation bumbles around a random distance from the origin. Very high values well above the critical temp might indicate poor equilibration before sampling configurations for the ensemble.
