    In this directory, there are four videos depicting MC trajectories in a system size N=200 over 1e6 steps at a temperature below critical: beta_J = 0.5. Only 100 snapshots of the lattice state at equally spaced intervals are used as frames.
    The Onsager <m> prediction for this beta_J is 0.911, consistent with the MC trajectory result. Each video rapidly equilibrates at all one spin or the other, with some fluctuations resulting in a sub-1 average magnetization.
    States initialized as all-up or all-down spins stay at that spin with fluctuations, but the randomly initialized lattice may "fall" into either spin state, as illustrated by the two randomly initialized videos that go to opposite spins.
    Spins initialized in one state tend to stay in that state because the nature of the Monte Carlo move acceptance naturally favors lower energy lattices. An all-one-spin lattice is an energy minimum, and fluctuations are quickly stricken down by the energetically favorable moves, which are accepted. This makes it highly unlikely for the lattice to "flip" its current spin state.
    Randomly initialized spins usually fall close to an energetic maximum, such that the stochastic nature of move acceptance can push the trajectory into an all-spin-up or all-spin-down valley. A true energetic maximum would be the "checkerboard," where any proposed move would be accepted since flipping that spin flanks it with four of the same spin.
