    For part 1b, the same arrangement of videos is made as 1a: initialized up, down, and two random with different final states. Both lattices that began ordered showed the same behavior -- remained in its starting state with minor fluctuations.
    The randomly initialized states "finished" with different characteristics. Unlike the 20x20 lattice, which rapidly converged to an ordered-like state, the 60x60 toils with converting homogenous pockets of spins to the other state. In 1_b_rand_1, down spins predominate early and only a pocket of up spins remain after 1e6 steps. The opposite is true for 1_b_rand_2.
    This should not be a problem, as it is likely that pockets of the larger lattice are able to converge to a certain spin and create warring factions with energetically unfavorable interfaces that are only gradually reduced in contact area. I hypothesize number of steps should not be constant with system size but rather scale so the larger system has more time to equilibrate.
